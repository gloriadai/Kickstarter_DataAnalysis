# Kickstarter_DataAnalysis
## Summary
I chose to do this project because Kickstarter is an interesting platform for both fund seekers and backers. It's a nice platform to check out for innovative ideas and projects, and I would like to have better understanding of Kickstarter.

The dataset 'ks-projects-201801' is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects

I mainly used Pandas, Numpy to do analysis, and Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly to create visualizations about the Kickstarter projects in order to gain interesting insights.


## Key Visualizations
Below are three key visualizations that give an overall idea of the Kickstarter projects: 
  - what are the projects
  - where are the projects from 
  - how the projects are doing

1. What are the most popular mobile food items that are offered by mobile food vendors in San Francisco?

As we can see from the above word cloud image of mobile food items in San Francisco, the most popular food items offered by the vendors include food items on cold truck, snacks, packaged sandwiches, pitas, hot drinks and breakfast. 


2. How many mobile foods are available during certain times and days of the week?
![](Visualization%20Images/MobileFoodHeatmap.png)

The above heatmap shows that much more mobile foods are available during week days than weekends. Also, the most mobile foods are available during lunch and brunch hours (9am-2pm). This shows that most mobile foods target to serve lunches and brunches for working professionals. 


3. Where in San Francisco are the mobile foods located?

From the initial view of the mobile food business locationson in San Francisco map for both trucks and push carts, we can see there are only few points on the west side. Most of the points are concentrated on the east and middle side, especially the northeast corner, and these areas are San Francisco's commercial areas with the most companies and business. This further shows that the mobile foods target to serve the working professionals. 

The food truck business locations are the orange dots on the map. Most food trucks are concentrated on the east and middle side, and only few food trucks are operating on the west side. The push carts business locations are the blue dots on the map, most push carts are located along Market Street, which is the main business street in San Francisco.
